NAME
    Games::NES::Emulator - An object-oriented NES (6502) emulator

SYNOPSIS
        use Games::NES::Emulator;
    
        my $emu = Games::NES::Emulator->new;
        $emu->load_rom( 'mario.nes' );
        $emu->run;

WARNING
    Don't get too excited -- this code doesn't really do anything yet. Don't
    complain to me that "Blaster Master" isn't working. It's not ready yet.

DESCRIPTION
    Games::Emulator::NES contains a set of modules to emulate a classic NES
    gaming machine.

RATIONALE
    I've always been interested in hardware emulation. I grew up playing the
    NES, so I figured it would be a decent place to start. Over the last
    year I've written some (non-functioning) code based on some freely
    available emulators on the web. Hopefully by putting the skeleton of the
    code online, it will spur me on to continue the development.

    As for choosing Perl for the emulation language, Perl is what I'm most
    comfortable with, and I don't particularly care about speed -- yet.
    Perhaps some bits can be rewritten in XS, but I'll cross that bridge
    when i get to it.

METHODS
  new( )
    Create a new instance of the emulator. Initializes the CPU.

  load_rom( $filename )
    Loads the rom from $filename.

  run( )
    Begins execution of the code found in the ROM.
